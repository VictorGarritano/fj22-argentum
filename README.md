=============

Java's Laboratory Project

ARGENTUM: Argentum is a project that was developed by Caelum, on its handout "APOSTILA LAB. JAVA COM TESTES, JSF E DESIGN PATTERNS",
applied on FJ-22 course.

The system features will be:

-> Summarizing NEGOCIACOES in CANDLESTICKS. Our basis will be the negotiations. We need to convert a NEGOCIACOES' list on a
CANDLESTICK's list.

-> Converting CANDLESTICKs on SERIETEMPORALs. Given a list of CANDLESTICKs, we need to create a SERIETEMPORAL.

-> Using technical indicators. For this, we will implement a small indicators' framework and to create some of them as a way to
facilitate the development of new ones.

-> Generating embeddable and interactive graphics on Java's GUI, from the indicators that we had created.
